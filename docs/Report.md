# Assignment

# Response 
Describe your response to the brief: your intentions, influences, and goals. What do you want to get out of this project? What is most interesting or exciting about this project to you? Do you wish to challenge yourself by adding any additional restraints beyond what was described in the brief?

# Design development

Show us the steps you took to approach your final design. What changes did you make along the way? What parts of your design did you consider especially important and spend a lot of time on? How did your design evolve naturally? Did you have any happy accidents? What did you try to do, but it didn’t work out? 
We want to see lots of pictures here, but you are also encoraged to write about your process.

# Experiments (colour, composition, techniques)
