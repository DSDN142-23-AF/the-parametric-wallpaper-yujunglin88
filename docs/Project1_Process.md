# Creative Coding Project Documentation
Your Name: Jeff Lin   
Project Name: Sausage World!

# Assignment 
Think about giving context to your project. Describe the project brief in your own words. What were you asked to make? What must you do to meet all the requirements of the brief? What are the key aspects you should consider to have a successful project? 

# Response 
Describe your response to the brief: your intentions, influences, and goals. What do you want to get out of this project? What is most interesting or exciting about this project to you? Do you wish to challenge yourself by adding any additional restraints beyond what was described in the brief? 

# Precedent images
As we have a naughty sausage dog and my wife absolutely adores him, I thought it would be really cute to make him the center piece of this design project. 

As she's into Disney/Cartoon like styles, in piticular more round edges than sharpe edges, and perfers lightish pink colour schemes, I thought it would be appropriate to have a cartoon styled sausage dog illisutration with more round/softer outlines, with a colour scheme around lighter colours. Oh and as our sausage dog is browned colour, that would be the colour we go with for the puppy himself.

Below are some of the initial ideas on roughly how it's going to look like, plus-minus some details depending on how the coding part goes.

# Design development

Show us the steps you took to approach your final design. What changes did you make along the way? What parts of your design did you consider especially important and spend a lot of time on? How did your design evolve naturally? Did you have any happy accidents? What did you try to do, but it didn’t work out? 
We want to see lots of pictures here, but you are also encoraged to write about your process.

    Started experimenting with p5 sketches and its functions, I thought it would be useful to first visualise the gride space on which I will be drawing and experiment my designs on, as this wold help with placing shapes a lot easier.

    We expect you to collect images and reflections on your work at least twice a week. This means this section should spread over 3 or more pages.

# Experiments (colour, composition, techniques)
What did you try out and then choose not to go with? Did you try a few different versions of the same thing? How did you decide on your final design? What techniques did you attempt to implement, but the result didn’t turn out as expected?

# Reflection:
How did your project go? Did you achieve your goals? How well does the final project respond to the brief? If you had more time, what would you change / what would you do differently next time? Reflect on the project as a whole.
